                Sportsbet has been a leader in establishing responsible gambling
                initiatives and tools to protect its customers and the wider
                community. It has supported restrictions on advertising to
                mitigate the risk of advertising indirectly to minors (such as
                restrictions on television advertising prior to 8PM), and in
                2017 played a key role in establishing the independent peak body
                representing online wagering, Responsible Wagering Australia.

              <p class="mb-3">
                In 2015, Sportsbet launched the responsible gambling tool, Take
                a Break, the industry's first self-service product, that allows
                customers to step away from using the Sportsbet product either
                temporarily or permanently.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sportsbet was also an early adopter of providing the option of
                Deposit Limits - allowing a customer to set a personal deposit
                limit in order to maintain control and limitation. Deposit
                limits can be set for a 24 hour, weekly or 28 day period.
